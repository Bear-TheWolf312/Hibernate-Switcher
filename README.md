# Hibernate-Switcher
A simple automator app made to switch the hibernate mode from default to 25 or back to default.</br>
This app simply serves one purpose, to make it easier for the end user to change the hibernate settings on their Mac.</br>
# Hibernate Modes</br>
3 or Default, is pretty simple. It places your MacBook in a mode where the RAM is still powered while the system goes to sleep</br>
this uses more battery life than hibernate 25, the hidden hibernate mode. This mode uses even less power by shutting off the RAM</br>
in hibernate 25 your RAM is coppied to your hard drive or SSD. This takes longer to wake from but uses less power as the system</br>
soon shuts off power to your RAM until it's time to wake up. Upon wake up all of your files are restored to RAM. The only draw back</br>
is that your computer ports are also powered off in this mode.</br>
